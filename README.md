**DISCLAIMER**: Not all debuffs that can be cleansed are shown, it's a limitation I'm aware of and have no intention of solving it due a lot of maintenance work. Also use this mod at your own risk, it doesn't have any type of automation and should be safe, but I'm not responsible for any problems you may face using this mod.
